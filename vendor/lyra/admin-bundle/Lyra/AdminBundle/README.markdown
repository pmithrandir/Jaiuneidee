LyraAdminBundle consists of a set of Twig templates, a base controller for
CRUD actions and some 'renderer' services to simplify the creation of a
backend area powered by jQuery and jQuery UI widgets.

This bundle is being developed to provide a common backend interface to all
bundles that make part of Lyra CMS, however it can also be used independently
from the CMS as a standalone standard Symfony2 bundle.

LyraAdminBundle is under development .

* branch `master` requires Symfony 2.1
